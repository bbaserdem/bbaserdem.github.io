I have arrived to the blogosphere!

With that out of the way; this blog will most likely be about;

* My linux computational environment
* My research projects

Yup. This will mostly be a blog documenting my linux system management.
I realized that if I were to perish due to COVID;
all this Linux tips and tricks I have gathered will die with me.
I will slowly imprint my workflow into the net in an attempt to fight that anxiety.

# History of my OS journey

I switched OS's from Windows 7 to macOS Snow Leopard, I believe, in 2010.
And I loved the switch; I really enjoyed a fresh design.
Then I started learning how to code,
and things seemed a bit more inaccessible than what they should have been.
I started getting interested in this open source operating system,
and started to use Linux Mint; because coding and compiling was easier.
(I was learning C at the time.)
My biggest success of 2013 was that I managed to triple boot
(only for three weeks) Windows 7, OSX Mountain Lion and Linux Mint.
(In retrospect; I was using a hybrid MBR partition table. I was out of my mind.)

Then I found that, both for coding (working in a C++ framework called ROOT from CERN)
and for social media; I was using more and more Linux.
macOS became unneccessary, bloated, unintuitive to use with the GUI changes.
Windows was only useful for gaming. (Now I transitioned to gaming exclusively on Linux.)
So, after moving to the US for my degree, I decided to switch to Linux full time.

Currently, I'm running Arch Linux.
One day, I hope to have enough willpower, dedication 
and time to switch to Gentoo Linux.
(Still have not managed to compile a good kernel for my computers.)

# TL;DR:

I am a Linux supporter; having run, at various times,
(and at one time, all of them at the same time)

* Linux Mint
* Ubuntu
* OpenSUSE
* Manjaro
* Solus
* SteamOS
* Debian
* Arch Linux

However, my distro hopping days have ended on Arch Linux;
as I find it the most convenient and the easiest to run out of all Linux distros.
I am not implying Arch is a good OS for someone outside the community.
But once you get an idea how Linux bases OS's work,
they are all the same except the package manager.
Arch is definitely the easiest and the most comfortable to use.

I have a good OS thing going on with Arch, and I plan, in this blog,
on documenting how I use Arch almost as my personal meta distro,
along with my general workflow.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy the content to come.
