I am starting a blog!

I'll do a quick rundown on myself as my first blog post.
My name is Batu, and I am a physicist in training.
(Fun fact; my *older* brother and I have the same nickname.
It leads to endless confusion and amusement.)
I did my undergrad in Bosphorus University in Istanbul, Turkey.
(Also, where I am born and raised.)
I came to Stony Brook University (in New York, USA) to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics.
While initially Theoretical Cosmology was my passion;
I lost interest in pursuing a career in the field.
(I still love and actively study in this topic,
but I am not doing any active research.)
Instead, I am interested greatly in the theoretical side Machine Learning,
and how it can be used to understand the brain.
Hence, currently I also count as a Computational Neuroscientist.
Topic wise; my main interest topics are;

* Fluid Mechanics (especially alternative formulations to grid-based methods)
* Network Theory
* Information Theory
* Differential Geometry

While I may still be a budding flower in the science world,
research and career options I am interested in pursuing is as following;

* Sustainability
* Machine Learning in Design
* Automation
* Developing understanding of Neural Network models
* Using ML methods for music

Other than that; I enjoy;

* Hiking
* Open source software
* Listening to music
* Saving the world, sitting at a rakı table.
* Eating new and exciting (and regional) food.
* Getting inebriated with new people and (what I hope are) friends.
* Martial arts
* Physical activities (If I feel like dying it's better!)
* Discussing and learning fringe psychology.

With that out of the way; this blog will most likely be about;

* My research projects
* My love for using lists in markdown format
* My linux computational environment

Who am I kidding, this will mostly be a blog documenting my linux system management.
I switched OS's from Windows 7 to macOS Snow Leopard, I believe, in 2010.
And I loved the switch; I really enjoyed a fresh design.
Then I started learning how to code; and things seemed inaccessible.
I started getting interested in this open source operating system,
and started to use Linux Mint. My biggest success of 2013 was that
I managed to triple boot (for three weeks) Windows 7, OSX Mountain Lion and Linux Mint.
Then I found that, both for coding (working in a C++ framework called ROOT from CERN)
and for social media; I was using more and more Linux.
So, after moving to the states for my degree, I decided to switch to Linux full time.

Currently, I run Arch Linux. (With one day hoping to have enough willpower
and dedicated time to switch to Gentoo Linux.)
I am a Linux supporter; having run, at various times,
(and at one time, all of them at the same time)

* Linux Mint
* Ubuntu
* OpenSUSE
* Manjaro
* Solus
* SteamOS
* Debian
* Arch Linux

However, my distro hopping days have ended on Arch Linux;
as I find it the most convenient and the easiest to run out of all Linux distros.
(I am not implying Arch is a good OS for someone outside the community.
But once you get an idea how Linux bases OS's work,
Arch is definitely the easiest and the most comfortable to use.)

I have a good OS thing going on with Arch, and I plan, in this blog,
on documenting how I use Arch almost as my personal meta distro.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy the content to come.

(Excuse my spelling/grammar errors; forgot to turn the spellchecker in neovim.)
