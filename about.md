# Education

I did my undergrad in Bosphorus University in Istanbul, Turkey.
(Also, where I am born and raised.)
I came to Stony Brook University (in New York, USA) to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics.
While initially Theoretical Cosmology was my passion,
I lost interest in pursuing a research and career in the field.
(I still love and actively study in this topic,
but I am not doing any active research.)
(Feel free to contact me if you are contemplating a career in Physics,
as I have a lot of opinions that are shared better in person. )

What used to be my side passion is now, for which I am eternally grateful,
my primary passion.
Now, I consider my main interest as the theoretical side Machine Learning. (ML)
Rather than use it for data analysis only, I am interested in how our understanding
in ML can transfer into an understanding of the infinitely complex structure that
is the brain.

Currently, my advisor is Dr. Alexei Koulakov, of Koulakov Laboratory,
who guides me into my research on this exact topic.
For which I am a current member along with my great collegues;

* Sergey Shuvaev
* Ngoc Tumi Tran
* Hamza Giaffar

Hence, currently I also count as a Computational Neuroscientist.

# Interests

I like markdown lists, don't hate me.

## Academic

While my research is on ML, I have either interest or training in;

* Fluid Mechanics (especially alternative formulations to grid-based methods)
* Network Theory
* Information Theory
* Differential Geometry

## Career Direction

When I graduate; I will thrust myself to the global market;
looking for a job (or an academic position) within the fields;

* Sustainability
* Machine Learning in Design
* Automation
* Developing understanding of Neural Network models
* Using ML methods for music

## General Life Interests (that are appropriate for public record)

* Hiking
* Open source software
* Listening to music
* Saving the world, sitting at a rakı table.
* Eating new and exciting (and regional) food.
* Martial arts
* Physical activities (If I feel like dying it's better!)

# Name

My name is Batuhan, (Batu for short) and I am a physicist in training.
* `Batu` is pronounced like [**Vaatu**](https://youtu.be/BidasDE1WUc?t=99) from Legend of Korra,
but the `aa` is shorter, and the `V` is a `B`.
* `Han` like the german name `Hahn`.
* [This link works I guess](https://forvo.com/word/batuhan/)

## Fun Facts

1) My *older* brother (Baturalp) and I have the same nickname.
It leads to endless confusion.
2) My name comes from the grandson of Genghiz Khan.
Batu means something akin to hero.
Han is the Turkish pronunciation of Khan, which means king.
